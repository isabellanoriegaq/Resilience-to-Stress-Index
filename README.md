# Resilience-to-Stress-Index

The Resilience to Stress Index (RSI) can be defined as a sample dependent index that describes a subject's resilience to recover from stress derived from physiological data collected during a test. The code used to preprocess and analyze the data can be found as a jupyter notebook under the name RSI. In the Excel file "Results" the formula was applied to compute final results and statistical tests. Finally, there are two folders: one containing the data used for this test in .csv format, and another containing visual representations of each case regarding raw signals and PCAs. The folders will be completely uploaded by the end of the week.
